> * User wants to see available videos from a specific music artist on YouTube
> * The chatbot replies with a list of top 5 videos available for viewing
> * User selects a specific video from the list (using chat)
> * The chatbot displays /plays the video
> * BONUS: User controls start, stop, volume and speed (using chat)
> * And do one thing that surprises us :)
